    What is a paragraph? 
    Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to a central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as structural tools for writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression, and they also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly. Imagine how much harder reading and writing would be if everything was just one long block of text. 
    
    Thereâ€™s a lot of flexibility when it comes to writing paragraphs, but if thereâ€™s one steadfast rule, itâ€™s this: Paragraphs should relate to one main topic or point. The paragraph itself often contains multiple points spanning several sentences, but they should all revolve around one core theme. Just as sentences build upon each other to communicate the paragraphâ€™s core theme, paragraphs work together to communicate the core theme of the writing as a whole. 
    
    Thatâ€™s the basic idea, but in practice thereâ€™s more to it. Letâ€™s look at the four main types of paragraphs to learn how and when to use them. 
    
    Expository paragraphs
    Essays, academic papers, and journalistic articles mainly use expository paragraphs to thoroughly explain an individual point. These paragraphs rely on data, statistics, or citations from other sources to present facts and build up to an irrefutable conclusion. 
    
    Descriptive paragraphs
    Common in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction writing, a descriptive paragraph contains various details of the same thing, with each sentence adding new insight. A paragraph in a horror novel might describe how it feels walking around the woods alone; a love letterâ€™s paragraph might focus on the details of your significant otherâ€™s eyes. No matter the context, descriptive paragraphs are meant to provide the clearest picture of your subject. 
    
    Persuasive paragraphs
    For editorials and opinion pieces, persuasive paragraphs are meant to convince the reader 
    of a specific point, with each sentence presenting evidence or reasoning to support that
    point. Like expository paragraphs, persuasive paragraphs may contain data and statistics, 
    but here, these work to support an opinion rather than verify a fact. 
    The trick to writing persuasive paragraphs is knowing how to assert your opinion without sounding preachy.

    Narrative paragraphs
    If youâ€™re telling a story, fiction or nonfiction, 
    youâ€™ll need to break up the action into digestible segments so your reader doesnâ€™t get 
    confused. Thatâ€™s the purpose of narrative paragraphs: they break up sequential actions into related chunks, with one leading into the next, so that the reader can remain focused on the storyline.
     They donâ€™t use evidence or supporting arguments like the other paragraph types, but they still abide by the main rule of paragraphs about unity. 
    
    How to write a paragraph
    Knowing the different types of paragraphs is helpful for outlining a piece, but it doesnâ€™t tell you how to write one. Letâ€™s move on to some hands-on tips for writing a perfect paragraph, starting with a sample written in the academic paragraph structure of essays and school papers:
